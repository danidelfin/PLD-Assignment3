# add scenraio
Set = ShowScene()
# 1. ask for the money on hand and save to variable
Money = int(GetMoney())
# 2. ask for the price of an apple and save to variable
Price = int(GetPrice())
# add 2nd scenario
Set2 = ShowScene2()
# 3. compute the amount of money and price of apple by dividing the two variables to get how many pieces of apple can buy
Apples = int(GetApples(Money, Price))
# add 3rd scenario
Set3 = ShowScene3()
# 4. compute the pieces and price of apple by multiplying it and subtract its product from the amount of money
Change = int(GetChange(Money, Price, Apples))
# add a scenario
Set4 = ShowScene4()
# 5. display the money, price, and pieces
